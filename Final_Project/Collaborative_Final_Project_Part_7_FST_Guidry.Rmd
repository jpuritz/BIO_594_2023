## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Important Note
We are breaking up the final project into multiple `.Rmd` files, but they will be combined and knitted together at the end.  Please keep the naming convention that is in the original [repo](https://github.com/pdimens/2022-Tatlanticus_popgen).
This means that all files and directories should match.  This will help when one section depends on data from another.
