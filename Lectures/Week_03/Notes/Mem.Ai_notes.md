## Appendix- Probability and Statistics
### Statistical Paradigm Overview
Defining terms
- Parameter: true value of a whole population 
- Statistic: sample of the whole population; an estimate of the true value
- Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, median)
- Tests of differences (parametric and non-parametric)

Frequentist approach
- stating a hypothesis (null and alt.)
- collect data
- compute a summary statistic
- test hypothesis
- test/infer how frequently that we would observe our data by chance if our null hypothesis was true 

### Probability
Within frequency statistics is probability theory
- probability: the number of times the event will occur divided by the total number of events
- Product rule: the prob of two independent events occurring at the same time is the product of their probabilities
- Sum rule: the prob of two or more mutually exclusive events occurring at the same time is the sum of their probabilities
- Conditional probability: one event depends upon another event; prob of an event given that another event has happened; this is expressed

### Statistical measures and tests
Means
- Arithmetic mean
- Harmonic mean
- more sensitive to smaller numbers being included in the set
- Geometric mean

Variation
- Sample variance
- Standard deviation
- Standard error (SE)
- standard deviation divided by the sample size
- 1.96 * SE = 95% confidence interval, if your data is normally distributed

### Frequentist hypothesis testing, statistical errors, and power
- Probability distributions
- Binomial distribution
- [https://shiny.rit.albany.edu/stat/binomial/](https://shiny.rit.albany.edu/stat/binomial)
- Poisson distribution
- good for things that don't happen that frequently
- as the mean changes, so does the variance
- Normal/Gaussian distribution
- as the variance increases, the distribution flattens out
- Chi-Squared distribution


Type I error = false positive
- You rejected the null hypothesis but the alternative hypothesis was false

Type II error = false negative
- You did not reject null hypothesis but the alternative hypothesis is actually true


Precision - repeated estimates give similar results
Accuracy - tendency to yield estimates near the true population parameter value
### Parameter estimation, accuracy, and precision
### Likelihood statistics
- collecting data
- developing a math model with parameters
- inputting raw data
- computing the likelihood of the data given all possible parameters


Maximum likelihood estimation
- go through all iterations of the model and compare to the data, calculate the likelihood of seeing the data using each iteration of the model

### Bayesian statistics
- can incorporate prior information to compute a prob estimate
- directly yields the probability of the hypothesis being true (posterior probability)
- link to YouTube video in ppt slides


P(H|E) = P(E|H)*P(H) / P(E)
probability of hypothesis given the evidence = ( (probability of the evidence given the hypothesis )* ( the probability of the hypothesis ) ) / (the probability of the evidence)

There is a big influence of the prior data, but if you have enough data, even if the prior is completely wrong it will not mess up the result too much.
