Models allow us to define parameters, generalize results and predict future systems, test hypotheses \
Hardy-Weinberg assumes allele frequencies stay constant without evolutionary pressure \
5 assumptions of HW: \
	1. Random mating \
	2. No mutation \
	3. Infinite population size \
	4. No natural selection \
	5. No immigration \
In HW a population will not evolve \
Genotype frequency is the individuals with a certain phenotype/all individuals \
The three genotype frequencies are p<sup>2</sup>, q<sup>2</sup>, 2pq \
Allele frequency is the occurrence of different alleles with two possible alleles being denoted as p and q \
Allele frequency A=AA+Aa, a= aa+Aa \
Exact test determines every possibility assuming the null hypothesis is true \
Permutations creates computerized datasets \
Proportion of polymorphic loci can be used in studies of SNPs with large sample size \
Even with multiple alleles there are only two alleles present in a diploid organism \
HW Equation: p<sup>2</sup> +2pq + q<sup>2</sup>= p<sup>2</sup> + q<sup>2</sup> =1 \
HW can be used in Bayesian, ML and Frequentist approach \
Departures from HW in microsatellites can be due to null alleles \
HW can be used to filter areas of a genome under selection vs not under selection \
HW is based on the idea of binomial distribution \
