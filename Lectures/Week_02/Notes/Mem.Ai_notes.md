## Notes from Discussion

- Mutation rates higher in mtDNA than gDNA
- Allozymes = â€œAllozymes are allelic enzymes produced by a single gene, while isozymes are alternative isoforms of an enzyme that may be produced by the same or by paralogous lociâ€
- Microsatellites
- Highly variable
- High mutation rates
- Non coding regions - not under the influence of selection
- Genotype multiple loci at one time
- Transitions and transversions
- Transitions A â†’ G or C â†’ T
- Two similar molecular structures
- Happen more frequently because of the compatibility between molecular structures
- Usually will be a sense mutation, not resulting in a change of amino acid encoded by the codon
- Transversions --> the other ones
