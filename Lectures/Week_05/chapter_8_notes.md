### Chapter 8: Natural Selection

#### Discussion questions and notes:

1) How do we determine if a locus is under selection?

Mainly use Fst values introduce in chapter 9 but are there other ways?

Can use fitness (viability and fertility) to determine whether a locus is under selection

Relative fitness is assigning fitness number to genotypes which set the most fit genotype to 1 and then other phenotypes are relative to that.

How dow fitness relate to selection? Individuals or their genotypes will be selected for when the fitness is higher. Think about the moths example where campflagoued individuals. Differential survival that leads to reproduction. 

Fitness is difficult to track because you need to track reproductive output over a lifetime. Plant people have it easy.

How might we determine if a locus is under selection? If it is outside HW equilibrium, non-random mating, and limited migration
   
2) If translocation of individuals from another population can cause reduction of fitness in local populations, how are small populations supposed to be restored?

3) If models cannot account for selection should they be changed?

No they should not. Models like the Neutral theory can be effective benchmarks for other models to be built upon or for other models to be applied and theories to be postulated.
   
4) In the case of underdominance, what forces would be preventing fixation, or is fixation inevitable?

If everything stays fixed over time then yes.

In small populations fixation would be inevitable.

There might be a direction to fixation depending on the relative fitness of the two homozygotes.

See the drosophila example of how this happens. 

Change in environment can change fixation rate

Migration could change fixation rate

But at the end of the day fixation will be inevitable
   
5) If individuals with deleterious mutations are removed from a population, how would mutational meltdown occur?

Mutations may be so prevalent that they would occur anyway even if there are more fit individuals in the population.

Think Wooley Mammoths [here](https://www.voanews.com/a/mht-genetic-mutational-meltdown-doomed-woolly-mammoths/3748401.html#:~:text=A%20genetic%20%E2%80%9Cmutational%20meltdown%E2%80%9D%20helped,the%20population%20was%20in%20decline.)
