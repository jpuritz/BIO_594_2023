# Assignment due on 4/26/2022


## Part 1
In the directory, `/home/BIO594/Exercises/Week_12`, you will find a few useful files and two directories, `realdata` and `simulated`

I would like you to complete the following and push it to your own folder in this repository directory.

* For the simulated data
  * Filter the SNPs (you actually did this last week)
  * Run at least two outlier detection programs
    * Generate a VCF file with only neutral SNPs
  * Run at least one PCA and one DAPC with the neutral data
  * Perform at least two analyses from Silliman et al
* For the realdata
  * Run BayeScan
  * Run BayEnv
  * Run at least one PCA and one DAPC using outlier free data set
  * Perform at least two analyses from Silliman et al	
    
Each directory has a `popmap` `environ` and `LibraryInfo` files

`popmap` is a mapping of individuals to populations

`environ` is an environmental factor file for BayEnv

`LibraryInfo` maps samples to sequencing library

There are also PGDspider configuration files and an R file for BayeScan output plotting.


## Part 2

* Repeat the redundancy analysis documented [here](https://github.com/Tom-Jenkins/seascape_rda_tutorial)

### Have fun!
