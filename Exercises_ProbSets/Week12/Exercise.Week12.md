# Assignment due on 4/26/2022


## Part 1
In the directory, `/home/BIO594/Exercises/Week_12`, you will find a few useful files and two directories, `realdata` and `simulated`

I would like you to complete the following and push it to your own folder in this repository directory.

* For the realdata
  * Run BayeScan
  * Run BayEnv
  * Run at least one PCA and one DAPC using outlier free data set
  * Perform at least two analyses from Silliman et al	
    
Each directory has a `popmap` `environ` and `LibraryInfo` files

`popmap` is a mapping of individuals to populations

`environ` is an environmental factor file for BayEnv

`LibraryInfo` maps samples to sequencing library

There are also PGDspider configuration files and an R file for BayeScan output plotting.


## Part 2

* Repeat the redundancy analysis documented [here](https://github.com/amyzyck/EecSeq_NB_EasternOyster/blob/master/Analysis/PopGen_SeaGen_Analyses/RedundancyAnalysis/RDA_Outlier_Hap.Rmd)

### Have fun!
