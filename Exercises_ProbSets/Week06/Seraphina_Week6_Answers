## Problems


1. Cross and Birley (1986) studied restriction site vvariation in the region of alccohol dehydrogenase (*Adh*)gene of *D. melanogaster* ina  population descended from flies trapped at a Dutch fruit market in Groningen.  The following data was collected:

| *Adh* Allele | *Eco*RI Allele| Individuals|
|-------------|----------------|------------|
*Adh<sup>F</sup>*| *Eco*RI<sup>+</sup> | 22|
*Adh<sup>S</sup>*| *Eco*RI<sup>+</sup> | 4|
*Adh<sup>F</sup>*| *Eco*RI<sup>-</sup> | 3|
*Adh<sup>S</sup>*| *Eco*RI<sup>-</sup> | 5|

Where *Adh<sup>F</sup>* and *Adh<sup>S</sup>* are the allozyme alleles of *Adh* and *Eco*RI<sup>+</sup> and *Eco*RI<sup>-</sup> indicate the presence or absence of an *Eco*RI restriction site 3.5 kb downstream
   * Test for the presence of linkage disequilibrium
   * If significant, express *D* relative to its theoretical maximum or minimum.

2. Three linked loci in a random mating population have the gametic frequencies shown in the table below. Calculate the linkage disequilibrium *D*/*D<sub>max</sub>* between each pair of genes. Explain why the results seem paradoxical.

|Genotype | Frequency|
|---------|------|
| *ABC*| 0.25|
| *ABc*| 0|
| *AbC*| 0.25|
|*Abc*| 0|
|*aBC* | 0|
|*aBc* | 0.25|
|*abC* | 0|
|*abc*|0.25|

3. Two populations are examined for the same pair of loci with the following results in terms of two-locus gamete numbers:

|Population|Gamete| Count|
|----------|------|-------|
| Pop 1| AB | 720|
| Pop 1| Ab | 180|
| Pop 1| aB | 80|
| Pop 1| ab | 20|
| Pop 2| AB | 300|
| Pop 2| Ab | 2700|
| Pop 2| aB | 700|
| Pop 2| ab | 6300|

These two populations are now combined to form a third:

|Population|Gamete| Count|
|----------|------|-------|
| Pop 3| AB | 1020|
| Pop 3| Ab | 2880|
| Pop 3| aB | 780|
| Pop 3| ab | 6320|

   * Calculate the two-locus gamete frequencies for each population and the gameticphase imbalance (linkage disequilibrium). Is any population out of linkage equilibrium?

   * What is the effect of pooling of the two populations on linkage equilibrium?

   * Suppose that the recombination rate between loci A/a and B/b is 0.1. What is the expected disequibrium in the offspring of population 3 (the parental gene pool), assuming random mating? In the second generation?

   * Can this single episode of admixture be detected in the population established from population 3 after two generations of random mating? Can it be detected in the genotype frequencies at the A/a locus after two generations of random mating? Can it be detected in the genotype frequencies at the B/b locus after two generations of random mating?

4. A continuous trait is distributed approximately according to a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation of 15.  What proportion of the population is expected to have a phenotypic value above 130?  Below 85?  Above 85?

5. A genetically heterogeneous population of wheat has a variance in the number A days to maturation of 40, whereas two inbred populations derived from it have a variance in the number of days to maturation of 10.  
   * What is the genotypic variance (V<sub>G</sub> or $\sigma_{g}^2$), the environmental variance (V<sub>E</sub> or $\sigma_{e}^2$), and the broad sense heritablilty *H*<sup>2</sup>, of days to maturation in this population?
   * If the inbred lines were crossed, what would be the predicted variance in days to maturation of the F<sub>1</sub> generation?

6. In comparing a quantitative trait in the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> generations obtained by crossing two highly inbred strains: 
   * Which set of progeny provides an estimate of the environmental variance?
   * What determins the variance of the other set of progeny?

7. In a cross between two cultivated inbred varieties of tobacco, the variance in leaf number per plant in the F<sub>1</sub> generation is 1.46 and in the F<sub>2</sub> generation it is
5.97. What are the genotypic and environmental variances? What is the broad-sense heritability in leaf number?
