Migration:
GAP-1: $$ {1-0.10 \over 4*0.10} = 2.25 $$
TPI-1: $$ {1-0.11 \over 4*0.11} = 2.02 $$
IDH-1: $$ {1-0.02 \over 4*0.02} = 12.25 $$
HBDH-1: $$ {1-0.62 \over 4*0.62} = 0.15 $$
GPD-1: $$ {1-0.11 \over 4*0.11} = 2.02 $$
PGM-1: $$ {1-0.14 \over 4*0.14} = 1.54 $$
IDH-1 and HBDH-1 have abmormally high and low Fst values respectively, while the Fst values for the other loci are relatively similar, this suggests that HBDH-1 and IDH-1 may be under selection in these populations while the others may be different due to drift.
Based on the fact that HBDH-1 shows very different allele frequencies based on the plant it is found on confirms my earlier interpretation that this locus is under selection.

When +/+:C<sub>y</sub>/+ is 1:1 $$ w={0^2*0+2(0.168*0.832)+0.832^2}=0.97 $$ Next generation is $$ {2(0.168)x(0.832) \over 0.97}=0.29 $$
When +/+:C<sub>y</sub>/+ is 1:0.5 $$ w={0^2*0+2(0.168*0.832)*0.5+0.832^2}=0.83 $$ Next generation is $$ {2(0.168)*(0.832) \over 0.83}=0.34 $$

$$ A_{1}A_{1} s=1.5/1.5 = 1 $$
$$ A_{1}A_{2} s=1.1/1.5 = 0.73 $$
$$ A_{2}A_{2} s=1.0/1.5 = 0.66 $$
The heterozygous effect is directional selection
5.
$$ q^2 = 0.13 = 0.36 $$
$$ H_{e}$={2(0.64*0.36)}=0.46 $$
$$\Delta$q per generation = -0.94/50 = -0.0188 $$
$$ q^2 = 0.99 $$ q = 0.995, p = 0.005 
$$ {0.01 \over $\overline{w}$} = 0.0288 $$ $\overline{w}$ = 0.347
s = 0.347
$$ 0.347={0.005^2+2(0.005)*(0.995)+0.99x$w_{22}$} $$, $w_{22}$ = 0.34
s = 0.34
6.
$$ z1 = (0-1)(0-0.62) = 0.62 $$
$$ z2 = (0-0.62)(0-0.47) = 0.29 $$
$$ z3 = (0-1)(0-0.47) = 0.47 $$
z = 0.47 + 0.29 + 0.62 = 1.38
ST* = 0.62/1.38 = 0.449
$$ $\overline{w}$} = (0.62/1.38)^2(0.47) + (0.29/1.38)^2(1) + (0.47/1.38)^2(0.62) = 0.18
