# Take-home Exercise for Week 10

### How many loci are there?

I've placed some files in the `/home/BIO594/DATA/Week10/` directory.  They are ddRADseq files that have already been demultiplexed.  

Using your new RADSeq assembly skills:

* Post a markdown document to this directory showing your efforts to answer the question: 
	* How many loci are there in the data set?

* Post a `reference.fasta` file with your assembled reference

* You can use the material from class or anything else you might find at [dDocent.com](dDocent.com)
